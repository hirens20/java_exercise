## Welcome to Bill's Pizza Cafe

We are excited to have you help us with our pizza menu app.
A few bugs are plaguing the app and we'll need your expertise in getting it back up again.

When ready please open the project in Android Studio.-   
-     Android Studio mininum version:  Bumblebee 2021.1.1
-     Java: Version 11

The sample json data is present in the project bundle in the assets folder.

You have been given either the app developed in Java or Kotlin depending on your request.  If you prefer the other language other than the one sent, please let us know immediately.


### Demo

### Instructions & Tips
- Please share your Android Studio and simulator window during the meeting.
- As the interview concludes, please zip and send back the project to your interviewer by replying to the same email you got this from. 
- Feel free to make this interview as interactive as you need, your interviewer is on your side.  You are welcome to make any additions you would like to
  increase readability or any coding standards you are used to, however since this may take time away from the location of bugs and bonus issues, this is not 
  recommended unless you have spare time.
- Consider this a real world bug assigned to you on the job and try to solve this the way you'd at work.
- It's ok to google if you really need to, though that will eat up valuable time in this 30 min exercise.
- We are interested primarily with getting the app to be display as in the provided demo, however there is the following additional issue as a bonus.
   When handling large amounts of data, there is a performance issue in the items taking a long time to display after json parsing has completed.

# ALL THE BEST :)
